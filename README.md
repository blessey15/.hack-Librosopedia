# Librosopedia
A simple web app to swap and contribute used books.
Our project is based on UN SDGs 4 and 15.
We aim to form a community for promoting the reuse of books.Thereby we can save a lot more trees from destruction.
Moreover we think we can support students from developing countries like India by providing books at a lesser rate.<br>

For every academic term or semester, thousands of new textbooks are being printed, bought and used. On the other hand, almost the same number of textbooks and course material are being discarded after its use and find its way to the garbage bins ultimately landing at the landfill site where they are being buried, compacted and disposed occupying precious land area.
We need to understand that it takes around three tons of trees to make one ton of paper which also utilize huge quantity of water per ton than any other product in the world. Paper making also produces high levels of air and water pollution which can be avoided. Each ton of recycled paper can save 17 trees and 7,000 gallons of water. It takes one tree to make 25 books.By recycling our books, we are giving that tree a new purpose and reducing deforestation.
