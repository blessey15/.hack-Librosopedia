# Librosopedia
A simple web app to swap and contribute used books.
Our project is based on UN SDGs 4 and 15.
We aim to form a community for promoting the reuse of books.Thereby we can save a lot more trees from destruction.
Moreover we think we can support students from developing countries like India by providing books at a lesser rate.<br>
